# RBAC Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) fixes implemented across the application to ensure proper security and access control.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Products API** (`/api/products/*`)
**Before:** No permission checks for creating, editing, or deleting products
**After:** 
- ✅ `POST /api/products` - Requires `PRODUCTS_CREATE` permission
- ✅ `PUT /api/products/[id]` - Requires `PRODUCTS_EDIT` permission  
- ✅ `DELETE /api/products/[id]` - Requires `PRODUCTS_DELETE` permission

### 2. **Sales API** (`/api/sales/*`)
**Before:** No permission checks for editing or deleting sales records
**After:**
- ✅ `PUT /api/sales/[id]` - Requires `SALES_EDIT` permission
- ✅ `DELETE /api/sales/[id]` - Requires `SALES_DELETE` permission

### 3. **Sales Reps API** (`/api/sales-reps/*`)
**Before:** Sales reps could edit other sales reps' profiles
**After:**
- ✅ Sales reps can only edit their own profile
- ✅ Admins/managers can edit any sales rep profile
- ✅ Proper permission checks with `SALES_REPS_EDIT`

### 4. **Clients API** (`/api/clients/*`)
**Before:** Sales reps could edit any client
**After:**
- ✅ Sales reps can only edit clients they are assigned to
- ✅ Admins/managers can edit any client
- ✅ Proper assignment checking through sales_representatives relationship

### 5. **Stakeholders API** (`/api/stakeholders/*`)
**Before:** Sales reps could edit any stakeholder
**After:**
- ✅ Sales reps can only edit stakeholders of clients they are assigned to
- ✅ Admins/managers can edit any stakeholder
- ✅ Proper client assignment checking

## New RBAC Utilities

### `lib/rbac-utils.ts`
Created standardized RBAC helper functions:

- `getRBACUser()` - Get RBAC user from session
- `requirePermission(permission)` - Check permission and throw error if not authorized
- `isSalesRep(rbacUser)` - Check if user is a sales rep
- `isAdminOrManager(rbacUser)` - Check if user is admin or sales manager
- `getCurrentSalesRepId(userId)` - Get current user's sales rep ID
- `canEditSalesRepProfile(rbacUser, targetSalesRepId)` - Check if can edit sales rep profile
- `canEditClient(rbacUser, clientId)` - Check if can edit client
- `canEditStakeholder(rbacUser, stakeholderId)` - Check if can edit stakeholder

## Permission Matrix

| Action | Admin | Sales Manager | Sales Rep | Viewer |
|--------|-------|---------------|-----------|---------|
| View Products | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Create Products | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Edit Products | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Delete Products | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| View Sales | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Create Sales | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Edit Sales | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Delete Sales | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| View Sales Reps | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Create Sales Reps | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Edit Sales Reps | ✅ | ✅ | Own only | ❌ |
| Delete Sales Reps | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| View Clients | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Create Clients | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Edit Clients | ✅ | ✅ | Assigned only | ❌ |
| Delete Clients | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| View Stakeholders | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Create Stakeholders | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Edit Stakeholders | ✅ | ✅ | Assigned only | ❌ |
| Delete Stakeholders | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Security Improvements

1. **Consistent Permission Checking:** All API endpoints now use standardized permission checks
2. **Own Data Restrictions:** Sales reps can only access/modify their own data or data they're assigned to
3. **Role-Based Access:** Clear separation of permissions based on user roles
4. **Centralized RBAC Logic:** Common RBAC utilities for maintainability
5. **Proper Error Handling:** Consistent 401/403 error responses for unauthorized access

## Files Modified

### API Endpoints
- `app/api/products/[id]/route.ts` - Added permission checks for PUT/DELETE
- `app/api/products/route.ts` - Added permission check for POST
- `app/api/sales/[id]/route.ts` - Added permission checks for PUT/DELETE
- `app/api/sales-reps/[id]/route.ts` - Added "own profile only" restriction
- `app/api/clients/[id]/route.ts` - Added "assigned clients only" restriction
- `app/api/stakeholders/[id]/route.ts` - Added "assigned stakeholders only" restriction

### Utilities
- `lib/rbac-utils.ts` - New centralized RBAC utilities

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test each role** with different permissions
2. **Verify sales rep restrictions** - ensure they can only access their own/assigned data
3. **Test admin/manager permissions** - ensure they can access all data
4. **Verify error responses** - ensure proper 401/403 responses for unauthorized access
5. **Test edge cases** - users without roles, invalid IDs, etc.

## Next Steps

1. **Frontend Integration:** Update frontend to handle 403 errors gracefully
2. **Audit Logging:** Consider adding audit logs for sensitive operations
3. **Permission Management:** Implement UI for managing user permissions
4. **Testing:** Comprehensive testing of all RBAC scenarios
